## 🧭 About Me
I am a **software developer and researcher** with a PhD in Physics, I specialize in developing high-performance data acquisition (DAQ) systems and FPGA-based solutions for complex experimental environments. I possess deep expertise in C++, Python and VHDL, having developed robust readout software, real-time processing algorithms, and custom GUIs using the Qt framework. My experience spans the full development life cycle, from system architecture and FPGA synthesis to database management and rigorous hardware integration. I am adept at implementing modern networking interfaces such as TCP/IP and Ethernet to ensure reliable data flow in large-scale distributed systems.

##  List of My Geek Tutorials
### Data Analysis
- **pattern_calls** : C++ project for beginners to handle information about pattern calls (visit [pattern_calls](https://github.com/ahmedqamesh/pattern_calls))
- **farm_analysis** : Python scripts dedicated to conducting analysis and statistical calculations, such as p-values and correlation coefficients, on real data collected from a farm in 2021 (visit `[farm_analysis](https://github.com/ahmedqamesh/farm_analysis)).
- **drug_analysis** : python  script helps in understanding drug interactions by reading data from an Excel file and processing it to find interactions between specified drugs (visit [drug_analysis]``(https://github.com/ahmedqamesh/drug_analysis)).
